## The Management Problem
How to increase employee engagement scores from 62% to 70% and reduce voluntary turnover from 18% to 13% without monetary benefits.

**Specific constraints:**
• Zero salary increase budget for 12-month period (Jan-Dec 2026)
• Must achieve results within existing operational budget ($2,000 per manager max)

## Research Context and Evidence Base
• Gallup Q12 2024: Organizations in top quartile for engagement show 18% higher productivity and 12% better customer metrics
• Meta-analysis (Saks, 2023): Recognition programs increase engagement by 5-15 percentage points within 6 months
• SHRM Total Rewards 2024: 73% of highly engaged employees receive weekly recognition vs. 23% of disengaged
• Society for Human Resource Management: Average cost per voluntary departure ranges $15,000-$75,000 depending on role level

## Current Situation (X) → Desired Outcomes (Y)

**Current State(example average based on research context):**
• Employee engagement: 62% (company survey, Q4 2024)
• Voluntary turnover: 18% annualized (HR records, Jan-Oct 2025)
• Manager confidence in motivation tools: 4.2/10 (leadership survey, Sept 2025)
• Recognition frequency: 23% of employees receive feedback weekly

**Desired State (12-month targets):**
• Employee engagement: 70% (+8 percentage points)
• Voluntary turnover: 13% (-5 percentage points)
• Manager confidence: 7.5/10 (+3.3 points)
• Weekly recognition: 65% of employees (+42 percentage points)
• Performance exceeds expectations: 45% (+14 percentage points)
• System sustainability: <2 hours per week of managers time

## PICOC Framework

**Population:**
• Individual contributors: 2-7 years of experience in organization, professional roles
• Team leads and supervisors: 15-25 reports from top manager roles
• Organizations: 100-500 employees, service industries
• Geographic focus: North American mid-market companies
• Timeline: Implementation Jan-Jun 2026, measurement through Dec 2026

**Intervention:**
• Peer recognition system: digital platform + monthly nomination process
• Manager training: 4-hour workshop + monthly coaching sessions
• Autonomy expansion: flexible scheduling + decision-making authority
• Growth opportunities: cross-functional projects + skill certifications
• Implementation timeline: 6-week implementation with 90-day evaluation times

**Comparison:**
• Current state: continue current practices
• Outsourced programs: consultant-led culture change
• Internal capability building: systematic manager development approach

**Outcomes:**
• Primary: engagement score 62% → 70%, turnover 18% → 13%
• Secondary: manager confidence 4.2 to 7.5/10, weekly recognition 23% to 65%
• Timeline: measurable improvements within 90 days, full results by 12 months
• ROI target: positive return within 18 months based on reduced turnover costs

**Context:**
• Mid-market organizations with salary freeze constraints
• Mid-Market organizations struggling with motivating their employees
• Service industries: professional services, healthcare, technology
• Leadership commitment required: 2 hours/week per manager

## Business Case and Impact Analysis

**Financial Impact (using 2024 industry average):**
• Source: SHRM (industry guidance) reports a range of ~$15,000–$75,000 cost per voluntary departure depending on role level (2024).
  Use this as the baseline if company-specific replacement-cost data aren't available.
• Current turnover cost: 18% × 300 employees = 54 departures × $45,000 = $2,430,000 annually
• Target turnover cost: 13% × 300 employees = 39 departures × $45,000 = $1,755,000 annually
• Estimated first-year savings (difference): $2,430,000 − $1,755,000 = $675,000
• Estimated two-year savings (straight line): $675,000 × 2 = $1,350,000

**Strategic Risk:**
• Gallup 2024: Organizations with low engagement show 37% higher absenteeism
• PWC Future of Work 2025: 89% of employees consider leaving when recognition is inadequate
• LinkedIn Workforce Report: Companies lose 23% more high performers during salary freeze periods
• Competitive disadvantage: 73% of top talent prioritize growth opportunities over base salary (McKinsey, 2024)

**Implementation Success Factor indicators:**
• High management level sponsorship required
• Baseline 4.2/10 confidence must reach 7.5/10 within 6 months
• 65% employee participation target within 90 days
• monthly surveys + quarterly comprehensive assessment
