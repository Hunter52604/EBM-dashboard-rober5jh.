Stakeholder analysis

Purpose
Who must be involved to raise engagement from 62% to 70% without monetary benefits

Primary stakeholders
- Senior leaders (CEO, VP People): approve the program and budgets; want clear ROI and lower turnover costs (the business could save ~$375k in year one
if turnover drops as planned).
- Managers / team leads: run recognition, take the training sessions, and coach their teams. Their buy‑in is a must ; targets include manager confidence
rising from 4.2 to ~7.5.

Secondary stakeholders
- Employees: want frequent, fair recognition and growth; high participation drives engagement gains.
- Human resources / People Ops: run surveys, track turnover and Return on investment of new hires.
- Vendors (platforms/training): must deliver tools and workshops that help facilitate our program

Key evidence points
- Rotenstien ,JAMA 2018 ("Prevalence of Burnout Among Physicians"): review of 182 studies (109,628 physicians) reporting high and variable
 burnout measures, highlighting workload and recognition as important factors.
- Panagioti , JAMA Intern Med 2017 ("Controlled Interventions to Reduce Burnout in Physicians"): meta-analysis of 20 comparisons (1,550)
 showing small overall reductions in burnout; organization-directed interventions showed larger effects than individual-only approaches.
- JMIR mHealth uHealth 2021 (analysis of 2019 HINTS wearable data): in a sample of wearable users (1,300), 82% said they would share
 wearable data with their providers, indicating willingness to share through trusted channels.

Conflicts and opportunities
- Risk: Managers could see recognition as extra work or a checkbox; avoid this by co-creating meaningful recognition rules.
- Opportunity: HR and managers both save money if turnover falls—use that shared goal to get potential raises/company flourish.

 Potential Next steps
1) Get sponsor + HR + 2 manager leaders by 2025‑11‑01.
2) Run a 12‑week pilot Jan–Mar 2026 with representative teams, measuring engagement, weekly recognition rate, manager time, and intent to stay.
3) Decide in April 2026 to scale if engagement rises ≥4 points and weekly recognition ≥50%.
