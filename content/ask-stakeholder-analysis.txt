                    WHO: Stakeholder Cascade & Implementation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose: Identify who is affected by and involved in improving engagement from 62%
to 70% WITHOUT MONETARY BENEFITS (zero salary budget constraint)

## Five-Category Stakeholder Cascade

Implementation Dependencies (Decision flow downward, Feedback flow upward):

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Senior Leaders → HR → ⭐ MANAGERS ⭐ → Employees                            │
│  (Approve/Fund)  (Design) (Implement)  (Participate)                        │
│                                                                              │
│                    ← Vendors (Enable/Support) →                             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This cascade visualization shows that engagement initiatives require multi-level
coordination. Leadership approval is insufficient without manager execution; employee
participation is impossible without manager coaching.

### Primary Stakeholders

1. SENIOR LEADERS (CEO, VP People)
   • Role: Approve the program and budgets
   • Interest: Clear ROI and lower turnover costs (save $675K year one if turnover drops)
   • Concern: "Improve engagement WITHOUT budget increases" (cost containment priority)
   • Engagement: Quarterly business case updates with financial metrics

2. ⭐ MANAGERS / TEAM LEADS (Critical Implementation Layer) ⭐
   • Role: Run recognition, deliver training, coach their teams
   • Interest: Effective tools that don't create excessive workload
   • Concern: "Implement non-monetary interventions while employees expect raises"
     (middle management squeeze)
   • Target: Manager confidence rising from 4.2 to 7.5/10
   • Success Factor: Their buy-in is ESSENTIAL—without manager engagement, program fails

### Secondary Stakeholders

3. EMPLOYEES (Individual Contributors)
   • Role: Participate in programs and provide feedback
   • Interest: Frequent, fair recognition and growth opportunities
   • Concern: "45% exceed expectations—where's compensation recognition?"
     (performance-reward expectation)
   • Metric: High participation (≥65%) drives engagement gains

4. HUMAN RESOURCES / PEOPLE OPS
   • Role: Design programs, run surveys, track turnover and ROI
   • Interest: Sustainable programs that improve organizational health
   • Support Provided: Templates, vendor coordination, data analytics

5. VENDORS (Platforms/Training Providers)
   • Role: Deliver recognition tools and training workshops
   • Interest: Successful client outcomes for references
   • Requirement: Must enable manager success (not create extra burden)

Key evidence points
- Rotenstien ,JAMA 2018 ("Prevalence of Burnout Among Physicians"): review of 182 studies (109,628 physicians) reporting high and variable
 burnout measures, highlighting workload and recognition as important factors.
- Panagioti , JAMA Intern Med 2017 ("Controlled Interventions to Reduce Burnout in Physicians"): meta-analysis of 20 comparisons (1,550)
 showing small overall reductions in burnout; organization-directed interventions showed larger effects than individual-only approaches.
- JMIR mHealth uHealth 2021 (analysis of 2019 HINTS wearable data): in a sample of wearable users (1,300), 82% said they would share
 wearable data with their providers, indicating willingness to share through trusted channels.

              Manager Success Factors (Critical Implementation Layer)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Organizational initiatives succeed or fail at the middle management layer. Without
manager engagement, implementation will fail regardless of leadership approval or
employee participation.

## Four Key Manager Enablers:

1. 📚 TRAINING: 4-hour workshop + monthly coaching = capability building
2. ⏱️ TIME ALLOCATION: $2,000 per manager operational budget = resource availability
3. 🛠️ SUPPORT STRUCTURES: HR provides templates, vendors provide platform training = manager enablement
4. 🎯 RECOGNITION MODELING: Managers demonstrate recognition platform use = behavioral leadership

## Competing Stakeholder Interests Under Zero-Salary Constraint:

Interests don't align perfectly—implementation requires navigating these conflicts:

• SENIOR LEADERS: "Improve engagement without budget increases"
  → Cost containment priority

• EMPLOYEES: "45% exceed expectations—where's compensation recognition?"
  → Performance-reward expectation

• MANAGERS: "Implement non-monetary interventions while employees expect raises"
  → Middle management squeeze navigating between HR expectations and employee compensation expectations

## Resolution Strategy:

Create compensation alternatives that satisfy different needs:
• Recognition platform → addresses public acknowledgment needs
• Growth opportunities → provides career advancement
• Autonomy expansion → provides intrinsic motivation
• Manager coaching → demonstrates investment in people

Conflicts and Opportunities:
- RISK: Managers could see recognition as extra work or a checkbox; avoid this by
  co-creating meaningful recognition rules and ensuring <2 hours/week time burden.
- OPPORTUNITY: HR and managers both save money if turnover falls—use that shared goal
  to build coalition for non-monetary engagement investment.

                              Implementation Roadmap
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Next Steps (Maintaining ZERO SALARY BUDGET constraint throughout):

1) COALITION BUILDING (by Nov 2025)
   • Secure executive sponsor + HR + 2 manager champions
   • Emphasize $675K savings opportunity from turnover reduction

2) 12-WEEK PILOT (Jan-Mar 2026)
   • Small-scale test with representative teams
   • Measure: engagement, weekly recognition rate, manager time burden, intent to stay
   • Constraint reminder: All improvements achieved with $2,000 per manager max

3) EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION (April 2026)
   • Scale if: engagement rises ≥4 points AND weekly recognition ≥50% AND manager usefulness ≥7/10
   • Course-correct if criteria not met
   • Full rollout only if pilot demonstrates measurable success WITHOUT monetary incentives
