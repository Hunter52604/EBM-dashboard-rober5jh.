Stakeholder analysis — focused

Purpose
Who must be involved to raise engagement from 62% to 70% and cut voluntary turnover from 18% to 13% during a salary freeze. Keep solutions low-cost (≤ $50/employee/year) and low‑time for managers (≤2 hours/week).

Primary stakeholders
- Senior leaders (CEO, VP People): approve the program and budgets; want clear ROI and lower turnover costs (the business could save ~$375k in year one if turnover drops as planned).
- Managers / team leads: run recognition, take the 4‑hour training, and coach their teams. Their buy‑in is essential; targets include manager confidence rising from 4.2 to ~7.5.

Secondary stakeholders
- Employees: want frequent, fair recognition and growth; high participation drives engagement gains.
- HR / People Ops: run surveys, track turnover and ROI, and manage vendors inside the budget cap.
- Vendors (platforms/training): must deliver tools and workshops that fit the $50/person limit.

Key evidence points
- A large review looked at 182 studies (109,628 doctors) and found many reported high burnout — this shows workload and recognition matter.
- A meta-analysis of interventions across many studies found small improvements in burnout, with organization-level changes working better than individual-only fixes.
- In one survey, about 82% of wearable users said they would share data with their providers, showing people often accept data sharing when trusted channels exist.
- Other surveys show roughly half of people are willing to share some health data (like prescription history) but many have strong privacy concerns — so clear consent and communication are needed.

Conflicts and opportunities
- Risk: Managers could see recognition as extra work or a checkbox; avoid this by co-creating meaningful recognition rules.
- Opportunity: HR and managers both save money if turnover falls—use that shared goal to get quick pilot funding and support.

Next steps (practical)
1) Get sponsor + HR + 2 manager champions by 2025‑11‑01.
2) Run a 12‑week pilot Jan–Mar 2026 with representative teams, measuring engagement, weekly recognition rate, manager time, and intent to stay.
3) Decide in April 2026 to scale if engagement rises ≥4 points and weekly recognition ≥50%.
