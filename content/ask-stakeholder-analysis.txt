Stakeholder analysis (tailored to the Ask problem definition)

Purpose
Identify who must be engaged to lift engagement from 62%→70% and cut voluntary turnover 18%→13% within the salary-freeze constraints (Jan–Dec 2026). Priorities: feasible pilots within $50/employee and measurable KPIs.

Primary stakeholders (high influence, high interest)
- Senior leadership / Sponsors (CEO, VPs): Authorize budgets, set targets (ROI, timelines), and enable cross-functional alignment. Their support is required to fund a $30k program and accept a 6–12 week pilot window.
- Managers / Team leads: Day-to-day implementers responsible for weekly recognition, manager training uptake, and keeping manager time ≤2 hours/week. They directly influence engagement and turnover outcomes.

Secondary stakeholders (varying influence / interest)
- Individual contributors (employees): High interest; their participation (target 65% weekly recognition) drives engagement scores and turnover outcomes.
- HR and People Ops: Design measurement (monthly pulse), run surveys, track turnover (baseline 18% on 300 employees) and calculate ROI from savings (~$375k annual potential).
- Training vendors / Platform providers: Provide manager workshops and peer-recognition tooling within the $50/employee/year cap.

Stakeholder concerns & motivations
- Managers: need low-friction interventions that demonstrably save time and improve team performance (target: manager confidence 4.2→7.5/10).
- Employees: seek frequent recognition and growth; willingness to engage depends on perceived fairness and time cost.
- HR/Finance: require measurable ROI (target: positive return within 18 months) and adherence to the frozen-salary constraint.

Potential conflicts & alignment opportunities
- Conflict: Managers pressured to hit KPIs may push recognition as checkbox; mitigate with co-designed recognition criteria and manager coaching.
- Alignment: HR and managers both benefit from reduced turnover costs (using $25k per hire baseline) — use this shared value to prioritize pilot resources.

Actionable next steps
1) Convene sponsor + HR + two manager champions by 2025-11-01. 2) Run a 12-week pilot Jan–Mar 2026 with n≈300 (or representative teams), measuring engagement, turnover intent, weekly recognition rate, and manager time. 3) Decision gate on April 2026 to scale if engagement improves ≥4 points and weekly recognition ≥50%.

Quality Standards — Professional content requirements
- Specific: include actual numbers, dates and measurable criteria (example: pilot: 6-week run from 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-13; success target: reduce average email response time from 72h to <=48h).
- Evidence-based: support claims with reasoning, links to `content/evidence-*` notes, or short citations (e.g., survey n=84, mean satisfaction 3.1/5).
- Organized: use headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists for quick managerial review.
- Actionable: each recommendation should include an owner, timeline, and measurable target (who / by when / KPI).

Avoid These Common Mistakes
- Vague goals: avoid statements like “improve employee satisfaction” — instead state target and measure (e.g., increase Net Promoter Score from 12 to 30 within 6 months).
- Blind copying: don’t paste template text without contextual numbers or dates specific to the organisation.
- Missing constraints: include real-world limits (staff capacity, budget, legal/regulatory deadlines).

Getting Started Tips
- Choose a real problem you can observe or measure within 2–4 weeks (example: "email response time >48 hours causes 3-week project delays").
- Start with Problem Definition: finalize this file first — it should state the issue, impact, baseline metrics, and a target outcome.
- Be Specific and Manager-Focused: include the decision the manager needs to make, the options, estimated costs, and expected KPIs so they can act.

(Replace example numbers and dates above with your project-specific data and evidence links.)
