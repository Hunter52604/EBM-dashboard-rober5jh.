# Success criteria — SMART framework

## Primary success metrics

**Employee engagement (primary)**
- Target: +4 percentage points increase in survey scores for program teams
- Method: 5-question team survey at Week 6
- Evidence basis: similar interventions achieve 3-7 point improvements with 2 hours/week manager investment

**Voluntary turnover (impact if scaled)**
- Target: 10% reduction in annualized turnover
- Method: 12-month continued rate from the companies HR databases
- Evidence basis: meta-analyses of other organizations show 5-15% reductions from development programs

**Productivity (team-level)** — [ACHIEVABLE]
- Target: +3% output or −5% task cycle time for program teams
- Method: team KPIs (specific to each company) or service metrics (response time, customer satisfaction)
- Timeline: Week 0 survey scores and KPI data vs. Week 6

## Secondary indicators — [MEASURABLE & RELEVANT]
- Manager usefulness rating ≥7/10 in program debrief
- Survey response rate ≥60% in program teams
- Increase in peer recognition nominations per month

## Leading indicators (early telltale signs) — [RELEVANT]
- Positive: higher participation in improvement activities within first 2 weeks
- Red flags: falling survey response rates, negative feedback comments, manager reports of >2 hours burden

## Timeline for results — [TIME-BOUND]
- **0-6 weeks:** implement program, collect Week 0 survey scores, turnover rates, and team KPI data
- **6-8 weeks:** analyze results and create decision brief
- **3-6 months:** scale decision based on engagement scores, productivity data, and manager ratings
- **12 months:** evaluate sustained turnover effects if scaled

## Success decision rule — [ACHIEVABLE & RELEVANT]
Recommend scaling if: if engagement improves +4 points OR productivity improves +3%, AND managers rate program ≥7/10 usefulness, and no red flags detected.
