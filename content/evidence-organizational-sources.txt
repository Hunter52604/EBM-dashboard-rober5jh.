CRITICAL APPRAISAL (Evaluating Organizational Data Quality)

## Data Source Quality Test

**Repository:** FEVS 2024 (Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey)
**Conducted By:** U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)

**Credibility Indicators:**
- **Official Source:** U.S. government agency (established 1979)
- **Large Sample:** 600,000+ federal employee responses
- **Professional Methodology:** 20+ years consistent methodology
- **Transparency:** Full documentation of methods, response rates, variables

**Trustworthiness Concerns:**
- **Context Mismatch:** Federal/public sector vs. our private organization
- **Scale Difference:** Includes agencies with 10,000+ employees (we have 50)
- **Self-Report Bias:** Survey responses (not objective performance data)
- **Response Rate:** Typical 40-50% response rate (non-response bias present)

**Relevance to Our Situation:**
- Engagement variables align with our X (Engagement/turnover)
- Recognition questions directly relevant to our M (Recognition)
- Turnover intent relevant to our Y (Engagement Increase)
- Federal context may differ from professional services
- Large organization patterns may not match our 50-employee size

**Overall Data Quality:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- High credibility source (OPM professional survey)
- Moderate context applicability (sector/size differences)
- Use as benchmark (not direct equivalent)

        CRITICAL APPRAISAL: 10 BARRIERS FRAMEWORK
===============================================================================

## Barrier 1: Inaccurate Data

**Does this barrier apply?** ⚠️ PARTIALLY

**Data Collection Process (FEVS):**
- OPM administers validated survey instrument ✓
- Direct download from OPM public data file ✓
- Combined multiple engagement questions (standard practice) ✓

**Potential Inaccuracies:**
- Self-report bias (perceptions vs. objective measures)
- Non-response bias (40-50% response rate)
- Social desirability effects

**How we addressed:** Large sample (600K) reduces random error; focused on patterns not precise estimates

**Severity:** MODERATE - Self-report and non-response create uncertainty

**Confidence Impact:** MODERATE NEGATIVE

---

## Barrier 2: Misleading Graphs

**Does this barrier apply?** ❌ NO

**Assessment:**
- No graphs or visual representations used in FEVS data extraction
- Used raw percentages and descriptive statistics only
- Presented data in tables (transparent, not manipulated)

**Confidence Impact:** NEUTRAL - Not applicable to this evidence

---

## Barrier 3: Missing Contextual Information

**Does this barrier apply?** ⚠️ YES

**Missing Context:**
- No private sector comparison (federal vs. professional services)
- FEVS small (<100) isn't same as our 50 employees
- No professional services-specific benchmark
- Single snapshot (Spring 2024), no sector trend

**How we addressed:**
- Used mid-size category (100-500) as closest proxy
- Acknowledged federal/private sector difference
- Will supplement with practitioner benchmarks

**Severity:** MODERATE - Limits direct comparability

**Confidence Impact:** MODERATE NEGATIVE

---

## Barrier 4: Irrelevant Data

**Does this barrier apply?** ⚠️ PARTIALLY

**Assessment:**
- **Relevant:** Engagement questions map to our problem, turnover intent maps to outcome
- **Potentially Irrelevant:** Federal-specific questions (political protections, union variables, federal pay scales)
- **How we addressed:** Filtered to only relevant engagement/turnover variables

**Severity:** LOW - Selected only relevant variables

**Confidence Impact:** NEUTRAL - Good variable selection mitigates this barrier

---

## Barrier 5: Measurement Error

**Does this barrier apply?** ⚠️ YES

**Measurement Precision:**
- Self-report survey (less precise than objective metrics)
- 5-point Likert scale (reasonable precision)
- High test-retest reliability (OPM validation studies)
- Different people interpret "Agree" differently

**Impact:** ±2-3 percentage point error margin (62% could be 59-65%)

**How we addressed:** Focus on meaningful gaps (4-5 points), don't over-interpret small differences

**Severity:** LOW-MODERATE - Standard survey error

**Confidence Impact:** SLIGHT NEGATIVE

---

## Barrier 6: Wide Confidence Intervals

**Does this barrier apply?** ❌ NO

**Assessment:**
- Large sample size (600K) produces narrow confidence intervals
- Standard errors are small due to massive sample
- Statistical precision is HIGH

**Confidence Impact:** POSITIVE - Large sample increases precision

---

## Barrier 7: Timing Effects

**Does this barrier apply?** ⚠️ PARTIALLY

**Time Factors:**
- FEVS collected Spring 2024, released November 2024 (current)
- FEVS relatively stable 2019-2024 (65-68% range)

**Temporal Concerns:**
- Seasonality (Spring vs. year-end)
- Economic context may differ 2024 vs. 2025
- 6+ months lag time

**How we addressed:** FEVS shows stability over time, short 1-year timeframe limits drift

**Severity:** LOW - Recent data, stable benchmark

**Confidence Impact:** MINIMAL

---

## Barrier 8: Sampling Bias

**Does this barrier apply?** ⚠️ YES

**FEVS Sample:**
- 600,000 responses from 2+ million federal employees (~30% response)
- Voluntary participation (not random)
- Federal employees vs. professional services organization

**How we addressed:**
- Acknowledged sector differences
- Used as benchmark, not direct comparison
- Will triangulate with other evidence sources

**Severity:** MODERATE - Sector difference is real

**Confidence Impact:** MODERATE NEGATIVE

---

## Barrier 9: Confounding Variables

**Does this barrier apply?** ✅ YES

**Confounding Variables in FEVS:**
- Job type (clerical, professional, technical roles)
- Agency mission (NASA vs. IRS different cultures)
- Geographic location (DC vs. rural field offices)
- Pay grade (GS-5 vs. GS-15 different experiences)
- Union membership

**Impact:** Hard to isolate "engagement" from "federal employment effects"

**How we addressed:** Filtered to mid-size organizations (controls for some size effects), acknowledged confounds

**Severity:** MODERATE-HIGH - Multiple confounds exist

**Confidence Impact:** MODERATE NEGATIVE

---

## Barrier 10: Interpretation Bias

**Does this barrier apply?** ✅ STRONGLY

**Correlation Found:**
- FEVS shows supervisor patterns correlate with engagement
- FEVS shows engagement/turnover correlation (18.4% intent matches 18% actual)
- Does NOT prove engagement causes lower turnover

**Alternative Explanations:**
- Reverse causation (high turnover → low engagement)
- Third variable (bad economy → both low engagement AND people stay)
- Selection effect (engaged people less likely to leave)

**How we addressed:** Labeled as "evidence for hypothesis" not "proof," will supplement with scientific evidence

**Severity:** HIGH - Critical limitation

**Confidence Impact:** MAJOR NEGATIVE - Reduces confidence in Y outcome prediction
