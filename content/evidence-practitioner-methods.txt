# Practitioner Evidence: How We Gathered Expert Insights

## The Problem We Needed to Understand
**Problem Definition:**
- **What:** 62% employee engagement (below 70% target)
- **Who:** 50 employees in professional services organization
- **Consequences:** 18% turnover rate, low weekly recognition (23%)
- **Constraint:** Zero salary budget for improvements

**Questions for Practitioners:**
1. Is this problem common in mid-market organizations?
2. What causes low engagement when compensation isn't the issue?
3. Do recognition programs work without increasing salaries?
4. Can manager training and autonomy improve engagement and reduce turnover?

## Which Practitioners We Sought
**Expertise Criteria:**
- **Domain:** Employee engagement and recognition programs
- **Experience:** 5-15+ years in HR, talent management, or organizational research
- **Context Match:** Mid-market organizations (100-500 employees)
- **Relevance:** Expertise in non-monetary interventions and manager training

**Why This Matters:** CEBMa emphasizes practitioner expertise must include relevant training, education, prolonged practice, and direct feedback in the specific domain

## How We Acquired the Evidence

### Method: Published Practitioner Research
**Why Published Research:** Direct interviews not feasible within timeline. Published research aggregates insights from thousands of practitioners and organizations.

**Source Selection Process:**
1. Identified major practitioner organizations with engagement expertise
2. Verified credibility (years of experience, data volume, peer review)
3. Confirmed relevance to our context (mid-market, non-monetary solutions)
4. Cross-validated findings across multiple sources

**Primary Sources:**

**1. Gallup Workplace Research**
- **Expertise:** 80+ years studying employee engagement
- **Practice Base:** 350M+ employee surveys analyzed globally
- **Relevance:** Recognition programs and manager effectiveness research
- **Type:** Applied research from consulting practice

**2. SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management)**
- **Expertise:** 340,000+ HR professional members, 75+ years publishing
- **Practice Base:** Aggregated experience from thousands of HR practitioners
- **Relevance:** Mid-market focus, non-monetary intervention research
- **Type:** Peer-reviewed practitioner research

**Search Strategy:**
- "employee recognition programs" + "engagement outcomes"
- "non-monetary engagement interventions" + "turnover"
- "manager training" + "recognition effectiveness"
- "weekly recognition frequency" + "results"

## Selection Criteria for Trustworthy Sources

**Quality Indicators We Verified:**
✓ Large practice base (millions of employees, thousands of organizations)
✓ Prolonged experience in domain (75-80+ years)
✓ Quantified outcomes (specific metrics, not anecdotes)
✓ Transparent methodology (how they gathered insights)
✓ Peer review or academic-quality standards

**Potential Biases Acknowledged:**
⚠ **Commercial Interest:** Gallup sells consulting services (may favor actionable recommendations)
⚠ **Publication Bias:** Both organizations publish more successes than failures
⚠ **Perspective Bias:** SHRM represents HR perspective (may underweight employee voice)
⚠ **Context Bias:** Most data from large organizations (may not perfectly match mid-market)

**How We Addressed Biases:**
- Used two independent sources to cross-validate findings
- Looked for consistent themes across both sources
- Focused on data-driven insights, not opinions
- Acknowledged limitations explicitly in our analysis

## Limitations and Gaps

**What This Evidence Doesn't Include:**
- Direct interviews with managers who implemented recognition programs
- Case studies from organizations with salary freeze constraints
- Professional services industry-specific examples
- Failed implementation stories (both sources emphasize successes)
- Small-sample controlled experiments

**Why These Gaps Exist:**
- Time constraints prevented direct practitioner interviews
- Published research focuses on generalizable findings (not context-specific cases)
- Failure stories rarely published in practitioner literature

**How We Addressed Gaps:**
- Used two independent sources with overlapping findings (increases confidence)
- Will supplement with scientific evidence (peer-reviewed studies)
- Will add organizational evidence (our own FEVS data)
- Acknowledged limitations explicitly in synthesis

**Overall Confidence in Practitioner Evidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- High credibility sources with extensive practice base
- Consistent findings across both sources strengthen confidence
- Context gaps (salary freeze, professional services) create some uncertainty

## Ethical Considerations
- All sources publicly available
- Proper citations provided
- No confidential information used
- AI assistance documented (for research, not analysis)
