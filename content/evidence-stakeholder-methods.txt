# Stakeholder Evidence: How We Identified and Consulted Stakeholders

## Problem Definition

**What:** 62% employee engagement (5 points below federal benchmark)
**Who:** 50-employee professional services firm
**Organizational Consequences:** 18% annual turnover (costs $200K+), productivity losses, client service gaps
**Proposed Solution (M):** Recognition Programs + Manager Training + Autonomy + Growth (zero salary budget)

**Why Stakeholder Evidence Matters:** Stakeholders can influence decision success, may be harmed/benefit from interventions, and their perceptions affect feasibility.

## STEP 1: Stakeholder Identification and Mapping

### Stakeholder Map: Internal vs. External

**INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS (Inside the Organization):**

1. **Non-Supervisory Employees (n=42)**
   - Classification: Internal, Direct, Primary
   - Why Relevant: Directly affected by engagement interventions, receive recognition, participate in autonomy/growth programs
   - Interest: Working conditions, recognition frequency, career growth, workload

2. **Managers/Supervisors (n=8)**
   - Classification: Internal, Direct, Primary
   - Why Relevant: Deliver recognition, implement training, manage M interventions daily
   - Interest: Training adequacy, time to deliver recognition, capability to implement changes

3. **CEO/Owner**
   - Classification: Internal, Direct, Primary
   - Why Relevant: Decision authority, budget allocation ($0), strategic priorities
   - Interest: Turnover costs, productivity, competitive advantage, ROI

4. **HR Function (1 person, part-time)**
   - Classification: Internal, Direct, Primary
   - Why Relevant: Implements programs, tracks metrics, administers surveys
   - Interest: Feasibility, workload, program success, data collection

**EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS (Outside the Organization):**

5. **Clients (Professional Services Recipients)**
   - Classification: External, Indirect, Secondary
   - Why Relevant: Affected by turnover (relationship continuity), benefit from engaged employees (service quality)
   - Interest: Service consistency, relationship stability, project quality

6. **Job Applicants/Potential Hires**
   - Classification: External, Indirect, Secondary
   - Why Relevant: Employer reputation, 70% engagement target affects recruitment appeal
   - Interest: Workplace culture, growth opportunities, recognition practices

7. **Competitors (Other Professional Services Firms)**
   - Classification: External, Indirect, Secondary
   - Why Relevant: May hire departing employees, affected by our retention success
   - Interest: Talent availability, competitive benchmarking

## STEP 2: Power/Interest Diagram

### Power = Ability to Influence Decision
### Interest = Degree Affected by Decision (Harms/Benefits)

```
                    HIGH INTEREST
                         │
                         │
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        │                │                │

        │  Power: LOW    │  Power: HIGHEST│
        │  Interest: MED │  Interest: HIGH│
        │                │                │
        └────────────────┼────────────────┘
                         │
                    LOW INTEREST

OTHER STAKEHOLDERS NOT DIAGRAMMED:
- HR Function: HIGH Power (implementation), HIGH Interest → CRITICAL STAKEHOLDER
- Job Applicants: LOW Power, LOW Interest → MONITOR only
- Competitors: LOW Power, LOW Interest → MONITOR only
```

### Stakeholder Ranking by Relevance:

**MUST ENGAGE (High Power AND/OR High Interest):**
1. **CEO/Owner** - Final decision authority (HIGHEST Power, HIGH Interest)
2. **Managers** - Implementation gatekeepers (HIGH Power, HIGH Interest)
3. **HR Function** - Program execution (HIGH Power, HIGH Interest)
4. **Employees** - Primary beneficiaries and success indicators (LOW Power, HIGHEST Interest)

**MONITOR (Medium Power/Interest):**
5. **Clients** - Indirect benefits, reputation impact (LOW-MEDIUM Power, MEDIUM Interest)

**INFORM ONLY (Low Power/Interest):**
6. Job Applicants, Competitors - Peripheral relevance

## STEP 3: Data Collection Methods (Secondary Sources)

### Why Secondary Sources?
- Resource constraints: 50-employee firm, part-time HR, no research staff
- Timeline: 12-week pilot insufficient for primary data collection (surveys take 4-6 weeks)
- Existing data: FEVS 2024, Gallup research, industry benchmarks already address stakeholder concerns

### Secondary Sources Used:

**1. FEVS 2024 (Employee Voice):**
- 600K federal employee responses on engagement, recognition, manager effectiveness
- Represents: Employees (proxy for our 42)
- Reliability: HIGH (professional repository, validated questions)

**2. Gallup Workplace Research (Employee/Manager Voice):**
- 350M+ surveys globally on recognition preferences, manager role
- Represents: Employees, managers, executives
- Reliability: HIGH (decades of data, rigorous methodology)

**3. SHRM Reports (HR/Employee Voice):**
- 340K+ HR professionals, exit interview data
- Represents: HR Function, departing employees
- Reliability: HIGH (peer-reviewed, large sample)

**4. Peer-Reviewed Research (Employee/Manager Outcomes):**
- Aguinis et al. (2013), Bakker & Demerouti (2017), Stajkovic & Luthans (2003)
- Represents: Field study participants (employees, managers)
- Reliability: HIGH (peer-reviewed, effect sizes)

**5. Industry Press (Client/Competitor Context):**
- HBR, Forbes, WSJ articles on engagement and client service
- Represents: Clients, competitors, general public
- Reliability: MEDIUM (journalistic standards, anecdotal)

### Primary Data NOT Collected:
❌ Employee surveys (no baseline exists)
❌ Manager focus groups (n=8 too small)
❌ Client interviews (no feedback mechanism)
❌ Exit interviews (no formal process)

---

## STEP 4: AI-Assisted Analysis

**AI Contributions:**
- Identified "clients" as indirect stakeholder (initially overlooked)
- Differentiated "power to influence" vs. "degree affected"
- Mapped stakeholder voices to datasets (FEVS = employee perceptions, SHRM = exit reasons)

**Human Decisions:**
- Ranked CEO/Owner as HIGHEST power
- Classified employees as PRIMARY despite LOW power (ethical consideration)
- Selected 5 secondary sources (narrowed for feasibility)

---

## STEP 5: Ethical Considerations

### Who Can Block Decision?
- CEO/Owner: Budget veto, strategic misalignment
- Managers: Refuse training, inconsistent delivery
- HR Function: Workload refusal, data collection resistance
- Employees: Low participation, cynicism (cannot block but can undermine)

### Who Benefits/Is Harmed?

**Benefits:**
- Employees: +8 engagement, weekly recognition, 28% lower turnover risk
- Managers: Training improves confidence (4.2→7.5), clearer expectations
- CEO/Owner: $56K savings (2.5 fewer departures)

**Harms:**
- Managers: 8-hour training burden, ongoing recognition tasks
- HR: Survey/tracking workload (~13 hours)
- Employees: Recognition fatigue risk, autonomy workload increase
- Clients: Transition disruption risk

**Mitigation:**
- Voluntary manager training (opt-in)
- Gradual autonomy increases (pilot small changes)
- Automate HR tracking (FEVS templates, Google Forms)
- Client communication plan (proactive updates)

---

## Limitations

**Missing:**
- No direct employee voice (relying on FEVS/Gallup proxies)
- No manager readiness assessment (don't know if our 8 managers want training)
- No client feedback (assuming engagement matters to them)
- Large-org bias in secondary sources
- FEVS data 6+ months old

**Addressed By:**
- Triangulation across 5 sources
- 12-week pilot allows course correction
- Mid-pilot check-ins (Week 6)
- Post-pilot primary data if successful

---

## Overall Confidence: MEDIUM

**Use For:**
✅ Identify blockers (CEO, managers, HR) - HIGH confidence
✅ Understand employee preferences (weekly recognition, autonomy) - MEDIUM-HIGH confidence
⚠️ Predict client reactions - LOW confidence (speculative)
⚠️ Assess manager readiness - MEDIUM confidence (generalized data)
