## STAKEHOLDER GROUP 1: EMPLOYEES (Primary Beneficiaries)

### What Employees Say About the Problem:

**Problem Recognition (FEVS 2024 Data):**
- **67.3% federal employees** report positive engagement (our 62% is 5.3 points below)
- **Lowest-scoring areas** (58-64%): Satisfaction with training, growth opportunities, recognition
- **18.4% turnover intent** matches our actual 18% turnover

**Employee Perceptions from FEVS Questions:**
- Q40 ("I recommend my organization"): Mid-size orgs = 66.2% (our target: 70%)
- Q12 ("Satisfied with job"): Employees value recognition, autonomy, growth
- Q69 ("Satisfied with training"): 58% positive (LOWEST score = growth intervention needed)

**What This Means:**
- Employees notice when engagement is below benchmarks (5-point gap is perceivable)
- Employees care most about: Training opportunities (58%), Recognition (varies by question), Growth (lowest satisfaction)
- Problem is REAL from employee perspective - not just management concern

### What Employees Say About Recognition (Solution Component):

**Employee Preferences (Gallup Data):**
- **Only 33% receive weekly recognition** (our 23% is 10 points below baseline)
- **2X quit risk** when employees don't feel recognized
- **Manager recognition matters most** - 28% of recognition impact comes from managers (vs. 16% from peers)

**Employee Exit Reasons (SHRM Data):**
- **79% quit because of "lack of appreciation"** (recognition-related)
- Recognition ranks #1 reason for voluntary turnover (above pay, benefits, work-life balance)

**Translation to Our Context:**
- Employees want weekly recognition minimum (our 23%→65% target addresses this)
- Manager-delivered recognition preferred (validates manager training focus)
- Zero-budget constraint NOT a dealbreaker (employees value non-monetary recognition 90% as much as pay raises)

### What Employees Say About Autonomy & Growth:

**Employee Desires (Bakker & Demerouti 2017 Field Study):**
- **Autonomy** = #2 engagement driver (β = 0.29 effect size)
- **Growth opportunities** = #3 engagement driver (β = 0.33 effect size)
- Combined with recognition: R² = 0.31 (explains 31% of engagement variance)

**FEVS Q69 ("Satisfied with training"):**
- Federal employees: 58% satisfied (LOWEST engagement score)
- Our intervention: Manager training + employee growth programs directly address this gap

**Translation:**
- Employees see autonomy and growth as core needs (not "nice to haves")
- Training/growth dissatisfaction is widespread (58% = majority unhappy)
- Our M interventions align with employee priorities

---

## STAKEHOLDER GROUP 2: MANAGERS (Implementation Gatekeepers)

### What Managers Say About the Problem:

**Manager Engagement Levels (FEVS 2024):**
- Supervisors: 70.1% engagement (5 points higher than non-supervisors at 65.8%)
- Manager-level engagement already at our Y target (70%)

**Manager Recognition Delivery (SHRM Data):**
- **Only 12% of organizations train managers on recognition delivery**
- Managers report: "Want to recognize but don't know how" (capability gap, not motivation gap)
- Manager confidence in giving feedback: Average 4.2/10 (LOW)

**What This Means:**
- Managers have higher engagement themselves (may not perceive urgency of employee problem)
- Managers willing to deliver recognition BUT lack training/confidence
- Capability gap (4.2/10 confidence) is solvable with training

### What Managers Say About Training (Solution Component):

**Manager Training Receptiveness (SHRM Data):**
- **88% of organizations DON'T train managers** on recognition (opportunity = untapped)
- When trained: Manager effectiveness increases 41% (β = 0.41 from Aguinis study)
- Manager recognition 2.2X more effective than peer recognition (validates training ROI)

**Manager Concerns (Harvard Business Review Articles - Secondary):**
- **Time burden:** "I'm already overworked" (8-hour training adds workload)
- **Authenticity:** "Forced recognition feels fake" (wants genuine, not scripted)
- **Fairness:** "What if some employees don't deserve recognition?" (equity concerns)

**Translation:**
- Managers support recognition concept BUT need training to execute well
- Training must address: Time efficiency, authenticity, fairness
- Manager buy-in likely IF training is practical (not theoretical)

---

## STAKEHOLDER GROUP 3: CEO/OWNER (Final Decision Authority)

### What Executives Say About the Problem:

**Executive Priorities (Gallup CEO Research - Secondary):**
- Turnover costs: Top 3 concern for CEOs (each departure = 50-200% of salary)
- Engagement ROI: "Every 10-point engagement increase = 18% productivity gain" (Gallup)
- Competitive advantage: "Engaged employees = better client service, innovation"

**Executive Perception of 62% Engagement:**
- **Below benchmark** (67.3% federal) = competitive disadvantage
- **18% turnover** = $200K+ annual cost (9 departures × $22.5K replacement cost)
- **Productivity loss:** Disengaged employees 18% less productive (Gallup)

**What This Means:**
- CEO sees problem as STRATEGIC (not just HR issue)
- Financial impact ($200K) justifies intervention investment
- Competitive pressure (other firms at 67%+) drives urgency

### What Executives Say About Zero-Budget Constraint:

**CEO Budget Concerns (Forbes/WSJ Articles - Secondary):**
- **"Recognition without pay raises = hollow gestures?"** (authenticity concern)
- **"Will employees resent no salary increases?"** (equity concern)
- **"Can we really improve engagement for free?"** (skepticism about non-monetary interventions)

**Evidence Addressing CEO Concerns:**
- Scientific evidence: r = 0.34 for non-monetary recognition (90% as effective as monetary)
- Practitioner evidence: $4.25 ROI per $1 spent (SHRM) - even small $ investments work
- Organizational evidence: FEVS shows engagement varies BY 10+ points WITHIN same pay scales (pay ≠ engagement)

**Translation:**
- CEO's zero-budget constraint is FEASIBLE per evidence
- CEO concern ("will it work without money?") is VALID but evidence says YES
- CEO needs reassurance: Non-monetary works IF implemented well (manager training key)

---

## STAKEHOLDER GROUP 4: HR FUNCTION (Program Executor)

### What HR Says About the Problem:

**HR Workload Reality (SHRM Data):**
- Part-time HR (1 person) in 50-employee firm = 1:50 HR-to-employee ratio
- Typical ratio: 1:100 (we're UNDER-resourced)
- HR already handles: Payroll, benefits, compliance, recruiting (adding programs = overload)

**HR Perception of Engagement Problem:**
- **"Another initiative to implement"** (program fatigue)
- **"Who will track metrics?"** (data collection burden)
- **"What if it fails?"** (accountability concern)

**What This Means:**
- HR is time-constrained (1:50 ratio already lean)
- HR skepticism about "one more program" is RATIONAL
- HR needs: Simple implementation, automated tracking, clear accountability

### What HR Says About Solution Feasibility:

**HR Concerns (SHRM Implementation Studies - Secondary):**
1. **Data collection burden:** "Surveys take 20+ hours to administer, analyze, report"
2. **Manager training logistics:** "How do we schedule 8 managers for 8-hour training?"
3. **Sustainability:** "Programs start strong but fade after 6 months"

**HR Support Factors (SHRM Best Practices):**
- **Simple surveys:** Use existing FEVS-style questions (copy, don't create new)
- **Automated tracking:** Use Google Forms + basic spreadsheet (no fancy software needed)
- **Pilot approach:** 12-week pilot reduces long-term commitment risk

**Translation:**
- HR support is CONDITIONAL on: Low burden, simple tools, pilot approach
- HR resistance likely IF: Complex surveys, manual tracking, permanent commitment required
- HR can be won over with: FEVS templates, automation, 12-week pilot framing

---

## STAKEHOLDER GROUP 5: CLIENTS (Indirect Beneficiaries)

### What Clients Say About Engagement (Indirect Evidence):

**Client Service Quality Link (Harvard Business Review - Secondary):**
- **Engaged employees = 10% higher customer ratings** (Gallup)
- **Turnover = client relationship disruption:** 67% of clients report "frustration when account manager leaves"
- **Service consistency:** Clients value same team members over time

**Client Perception of 18% Turnover:**
- Clients don't know our internal turnover number, but DO notice:
  - "Why is my account manager always changing?"
  - "New person has to learn my business again"
  - "Relationship continuity matters in professional services"

**What This Means:**
- Clients don't care about our 62% engagement score (internal metric)
- Clients DO care about turnover impact (relationship disruption, re-onboarding costs)
- Reducing 18%→13% turnover would improve client experience (fewer transitions)

### What Clients Say About Implementation Concerns:

**Client Risk Perception (Forbes Articles - Secondary):**
- **"Will service quality suffer during transition period?"** (implementation disruption concern)
- **"Are you experimenting with my project?"** (pilot risk perception)
- **"Why are you telling me about internal HR initiatives?"** (TMI concern)

**Translation:**
- Clients benefit from outcome (lower turnover, higher engagement) but don't need/want implementation details
- Client communication should focus on: "We're investing in team development" (not "we have an engagement problem")
- Client risk: Service disruption during 12-week pilot (mitigate with proactive communication)

---

## CROSS-STAKEHOLDER SYNTHESIS

### Areas of Strong Consensus:

**ALL STAKEHOLDERS AGREE:**
1. **Recognition matters:** Employees want it (79% quit without it), Managers willing to deliver it, CEO sees ROI, HR supports IF simple
2. **Manager role is critical:** Employees prefer manager recognition, Managers need training, CEO expects manager accountability
3. **Zero-budget is feasible:** Employees value non-monetary (r = 0.34), CEO skepticism addressed by evidence, HR prefers low-cost
4. **Problem is real:** Employees feel it (62% vs. 67% benchmark), CEO sees financial impact ($200K turnover cost)

**Strongest Stakeholder Alignment:**
- X (Problem exists): HIGH consensus (all stakeholders see 62% engagement, 18% turnover as problems)
- M (Manager training): HIGH consensus (Employees want it, Managers need it, CEO expects it, HR can deliver it IF simple)
- Y (Feasibility): MEDIUM-HIGH consensus (Evidence convinces most stakeholders, but CEO/HR have implementation concerns)

### Areas of Stakeholder Conflict:

**CONFLICTING PRIORITIES:**

**1. Time Burden (Managers vs. HR vs. Employees):**
- **Managers:** "8-hour training adds to my already-full schedule"
- **HR:** "I don't have 20 hours to administer surveys and track metrics"
- **Employees:** "I want more recognition, but don't make managers too busy to do their real work"
- **Resolution:** Pilot approach (12 weeks = temporary commitment), automated tracking (reduces HR burden), voluntary manager training (opt-in reduces resentment)

**2. Resource Allocation (CEO vs. HR vs. Employees):**
- **CEO:** "Zero budget means NO new spending" (strict constraint)
- **HR:** "I need SOME budget for survey tools, training materials" (small $ request)
- **Employees:** "If you can't pay us more, at least invest in training/growth" (indirect $ ask)
- **Resolution:** $0 salary increases (CEO constraint honored), Small investment OK for tools/training (HR gets $500-1K for pilot), Non-monetary recognition focus (employees get frequent appreciation, not pay raises)

**3. Pace of Change (CEO vs. Managers vs. Employees):**
- **CEO:** "I want results fast - 12 weeks max" (urgency)
- **Managers:** "I need time to learn new skills - don't rush training" (gradual)
- **Employees:** "I've been disengaged for years - when will things improve?" (impatience + long-term change fatigue)
- **Resolution:** 12-week pilot (meets CEO urgency), Phased rollout (training Week 1-2, recognition delivery Week 3+), Realistic expectations (engagement won't hit 70% in 12 weeks, but 2-4 point gain is progress)

---

## PRACTICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Who Can Influence/Block the Decision?

**HIGH POWER TO BLOCK:**
1. **CEO/Owner:** Can veto entire initiative (budget, strategic misalignment)
   - Likelihood of blocking: LOW (financial case is strong: $200K turnover cost > pilot cost)
   - Mitigation: Present evidence first (scientific r = 0.36, practitioner $4.25 ROI), emphasize zero-salary-budget alignment

2. **Managers:** Can impede implementation (refuse training, inconsistent recognition delivery)
   - Likelihood of blocking: MEDIUM (time burden, authenticity concerns)
   - Mitigation: Voluntary training (opt-in model), practical training content (not theoretical), recognize manager burden (celebrate managers who participate)

3. **HR Function:** Can delay/derail (workload constraints, data collection refusal)
   - Likelihood of blocking: MEDIUM-HIGH (1:50 HR ratio already lean, "another program" fatigue)
   - Mitigation: Minimize burden (use FEVS templates, automate tracking), 12-week pilot (temporary commitment), provide small budget for tools ($500-1K)

**LOW POWER TO BLOCK:**
4. **Employees:** Cannot block, but can undermine (low participation, cynicism)
   - Likelihood of resistance: MEDIUM (past failed initiatives create skepticism)
   - Mitigation: Communicate evidence (show this is data-driven, not "flavor of month"), involve employees in feedback (mid-pilot check-ins), quick wins (visible recognition in Week 1)

5. **Clients:** Cannot block (external stakeholders), but can pressure if service declines
   - Likelihood of resistance: LOW (clients benefit from outcome, unaware of process)
   - Mitigation: Proactive communication ("investing in team development"), service quality monitoring (flag any client concerns early)

### Who Is Harmed or Benefits?

**PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES:**
- **Employees (n=42):** +8 engagement points, 28% lower turnover risk, weekly recognition (23%→65%), growth opportunities
- **Managers (n=8):** Training improves confidence (4.2→7.5/10), clearer performance expectations, recognition skills
- **CEO/Owner:** $56K annual savings (18%→13% turnover = 2.5 fewer departures × $22.5K each), productivity gains (+18% per Gallup)
- **Clients:** Fewer account transitions (18%→13% turnover), relationship continuity, consistent service quality

**POTENTIAL HARMS:**
- **Managers:** 8-hour training time burden, ongoing recognition delivery adds tasks (estimate: 10-15 min/week per manager)
- **HR Function:** Survey administration (4 hours), data analysis (6 hours), training logistics (3 hours) = 13 hours total for pilot
- **Employees:** Recognition fatigue if poorly implemented (too frequent/insincere), autonomy may increase workload without adequate support
- **Clients:** Small risk of service disruption during transition (Week 1-4 of pilot)

**HARM MITIGATION PLAN:**
- **For Managers:** Voluntary training, practical content, recognize their contribution publicly
- **For HR:** Automate tracking (Google Forms + spreadsheet), use FEVS templates (don't create new surveys), small budget for tools
- **For Employees:** Gradual autonomy increases (pilot small changes), train managers on authentic recognition (not scripted)
- **For Clients:** Proactive communication, service quality monitoring, escalation plan if issues arise

## ETHICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Distribution of Harms vs. Benefits:

**BENEFIT RATIO:**
- **High Benefit, Low Harm:** Employees (HIGHEST benefit, LOWEST harm)
- **High Benefit, Medium Harm:** CEO/Owner (HIGH financial benefit, NO direct harm but assumes risk if pilot fails)
- **Medium Benefit, Medium Harm:** Managers (MEDIUM benefit from training, MEDIUM harm from time burden)
- **Low Benefit, High Harm:** HR Function (LOW direct benefit, HIGHEST harm from workload increase)

**ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:**

**1. Justice (Fairness):**
- **Fair:** Employees bear NO costs (only benefits) - they are primary stakeholders with HIGHEST interest
- **Fair:** CEO invests time/small $ but gets $56K ROI - proportional benefit to risk
- **UNFAIR:** HR bears HIGHEST burden (13 hours) with LOWEST direct benefit (no pay raise, no training, just "another program")
- **Mitigation:** Compensate HR fairly (budget for tools reduces manual work, acknowledge HR contribution publicly, give HR first choice of any future training opportunities)

**2. Non-Maleficence (Do No Harm):**
- **Risk:** Recognition fatigue (employees feel patronized by insincere "good job" spam)
- **Risk:** Manager resentment (forced training creates cynicism)
- **Risk:** Client service decline (transition disruption)
- **Mitigation:** Train managers on AUTHENTIC recognition (not scripted), VOLUNTARY training (opt-in model), MONITOR client feedback (weekly check-ins)

**3. Autonomy (Respect for Persons):**
- **Fair:** Manager training voluntary (opt-in respects autonomy)
- **Fair:** Employee participation voluntary (can opt out of autonomy pilots without penalty)
- **CONCERN:** Employees not consulted before decision (secondary data used, not direct employee voice)
- **Mitigation:** Mid-pilot feedback loop (Week 6 check-in with employees, adjust based on input)

### Stakeholder Representation Quality:

**WELL-REPRESENTED:**
- **Employees:** 600K FEVS responses, 350M Gallup surveys, field studies = LARGE samples, HIGH confidence
- **Managers:** SHRM manager data, Aguinis field study, practitioner evidence = MEDIUM samples, MEDIUM-HIGH confidence

**UNDER-REPRESENTED:**
- **CEO/Owner:** No direct evidence from CEOs of 50-employee professional services firms (using large-org CEO data as proxy) = LOW confidence
- **HR Function:** SHRM data mostly from large orgs (corporate HR depts), not part-time solo HR = MEDIUM-LOW confidence
- **Clients:** Indirect inference from HBR articles, no direct client feedback = LOW confidence

**REPRESENTATION BIAS:**
- **Large-org bias:** FEVS (federal), Gallup (corporate), SHRM (300K+ orgs) over-represent large employers
- **Geography bias:** FEVS (U.S. federal), some studies (European samples) may not match our context
- **Sector bias:** Missing professional services-specific stakeholder data

**Confidence by Stakeholder Group:**
| Stakeholder      | Representativeness | Power to Influence | Confidence in Evidence |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Employees        | HIGH              | LOW                | HIGH                   |
| Managers         | MEDIUM-HIGH       | HIGH               | MEDIUM-HIGH            |
| CEO/Owner        | LOW               | HIGHEST            | MEDIUM-LOW             |
| HR Function      | MEDIUM-LOW        | HIGH               | MEDIUM                 |
| Clients          | LOW               | LOW                | LOW                    |

## CRITICAL APPRAISAL: STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE QUALITY

### Representativeness Assessment:

**Question 1: How well does our sample represent all stakeholders?**

**EMPLOYEES (n=42 in our org, 600K+ in FEVS sample):**
- **Sample quality:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Why:** FEVS 600K employees is massive, diverse sample; Gallup 350M surveys globally
- **Limitations:** Federal vs. private sector, different org sizes, no professional services-specific data
- **Confidence:** Can generalize FEVS employee preferences to our 42 employees with MEDIUM-HIGH confidence (engagement drivers likely similar, but magnitude may differ)

**MANAGERS (n=8 in our org, thousands in SHRM/Aguinis studies):**
- **Sample quality:** MEDIUM
- **Why:** SHRM includes many managers, Aguinis study N=6,042 includes manager-level data
- **Limitations:** Our managers may differ (smaller org, different training needs, higher autonomy)
- **Confidence:** Can generalize manager training effectiveness (β = 0.41) with MEDIUM confidence (effect size likely similar, but our managers may respond differently)

**CEO/OWNER (n=1 in our org, no direct sample):**
- **Sample quality:** LOW
- **Why:** No 50-employee professional services CEO data; using large-org CEO preferences as proxy
- **Limitations:** Small-org CEOs make faster decisions, have different priorities, more hands-on
- **Confidence:** Can generalize CEO financial priorities (turnover cost concern) with MEDIUM-LOW confidence (our CEO may care more/less about engagement than large-org CEOs)

**HR FUNCTION (n=1 part-time in our org, 340K+ SHRM members):**
- **Sample quality:** MEDIUM-LOW
- **Why:** SHRM data mostly full-time HR professionals in larger orgs (100+ employees)
- **Limitations:** Part-time HR has different constraints, less specialized, more generalist role
- **Confidence:** Can generalize HR workload concerns with MEDIUM confidence (all HR face capacity limits, but part-time HR may be more/less flexible)

**CLIENTS (unknown n in our org, indirect evidence only):**
- **Sample quality:** LOW
- **Why:** No direct client feedback; using HBR articles about client perceptions as proxy
- **Limitations:** Professional services clients may value relationship continuity more/less than other industries
- **Confidence:** Can generalize client turnover concerns with LOW confidence (speculative, not data-driven)

### Impact Assessment:

**Question 2: Which stakeholders have real power? Who faces harm?**

**POWER RANKING (Ability to Block/Influence Decision):**
1. **CEO/Owner:** HIGHEST power (can veto entirely)
2. **Managers:** HIGH power (can impede implementation)
3. **HR Function:** HIGH power (can delay/derail through workload refusal)
4. **Employees:** LOW power (can undermine but not block)
5. **Clients:** LOW power (external, unaware of decision)

**HARM RANKING (Degree of Potential Negative Impact):**
1. **HR Function:** HIGHEST harm (13-hour workload increase, no direct benefit)
2. **Managers:** MEDIUM harm (8-hour training + ongoing recognition tasks)
3. **Employees:** LOW harm (recognition fatigue risk, autonomy workload risk)
4. **Clients:** LOW harm (service disruption risk during transition)
5. **CEO/Owner:** NO direct harm (financial risk if pilot fails, but ROI potential high)

**ETHICAL CONCERN:** HR has HIGH power AND HIGHEST harm = must address HR concerns to avoid blocking

**Mitigation Priority:**
1. **HR Function** - Highest priority (can block, faces highest harm): Provide tools budget, automate tracking, acknowledge contribution
2. **Managers** - High priority (can impede, faces medium harm): Voluntary training, practical content, recognize their effort
3. **CEO/Owner** - Medium priority (can veto, but financial case is strong): Present evidence first, emphasize zero-salary-budget alignment
4. **Employees** - Low priority (low power, low harm): Communicate evidence, involve in feedback, quick wins
5. **Clients** - Lowest priority (low power, low harm): Proactive communication, monitor service quality

### Confidence in Stakeholder Evidence:

**Question 3: How reliable is this stakeholder evidence?**

**STRENGTHS:**
✅ **Large samples:** FEVS 600K, Gallup 350M, SHRM 340K = HIGH confidence in general patterns
✅ **Multiple sources:** 4+ datasets (FEVS, Gallup, SHRM, peer-reviewed research) = triangulation increases confidence
✅ **Consistent patterns:** Weekly recognition valued, manager role critical, non-monetary works = consensus across sources
✅ **Professional quality:** FEVS/Gallup/SHRM use validated survey instruments, rigorous methods

**LIMITATIONS:**
⚠️ **No direct stakeholder consultation:** All secondary data (not our 42 employees' voices)
⚠️ **Large-org bias:** FEVS/Gallup/SHRM over-represent 100+ employee orgs (our 50 employees may differ)
⚠️ **Sector differences:** Federal (FEVS) vs. professional services (our context)
⚠️ **CEO/Client under-representation:** Low-quality proxies for small-org CEO and client perspectives
⚠️ **Temporal lag:** FEVS 2024 data from Spring 2024 (6+ months old), employee sentiments may have shifted

**OVERALL STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM**

**Why Not High?**
- Primarily secondary sources (not direct consultation with our stakeholders)
- Large-org bias in all datasets (federal, corporate, not small professional services firms)
- CEO/Client perspectives are LOW-quality proxies (speculative, not data-driven)

**Why Not Low?**
- Multiple high-quality sources (FEVS, Gallup, SHRM = gold-standard datasets)
- Large samples (600K+ employees, 340K+ HR professionals) = statistically robust
- Consistent patterns across sources (weekly recognition, manager training, non-monetary all validated by multiple datasets)

**Confidence by Decision Component:**

| Hypothesis Element              | Stakeholder Evidence Quality | Rationale                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **X (Problem Exists)**          | HIGH                         | Employees perceive 62% < 67% benchmark, FEVS validates gap                |
| **M (Recognition Valued)**      | HIGH                         | 79% quit without it (SHRM), 33% get weekly (Gallup), employees want more |
| **M (Manager Training Needed)** | HIGH                         | Only 12% train managers (SHRM), 4.2/10 confidence (capability gap)       |
| **M (Autonomy/Growth Valued)**  | MEDIUM-HIGH                  | β = 0.29-0.33 (scientific), Q69 = 58% satisfaction (FEVS organizational) |
| **M (Non-Monetary Feasible)**   | HIGH                         | r = 0.34 (scientific), employees prefer authentic over cash (practitioner)|
| **Y (CEO Buy-In)**              | MEDIUM                       | Financial case strong, but CEO perspective is proxy (no direct data)     |
| **Y (Manager Buy-In)**          | MEDIUM-HIGH                  | Willing but time-constrained, SHRM data shows 88% don't train (opportunity)|
| **Y (HR Buy-In)**               | MEDIUM                       | Workload concern valid, but tools/automation can mitigate               |
| **Y (Employee Buy-In)**         | HIGH                         | Employees are primary beneficiaries, low harm, high interest             |
| **Y (Client Acceptance)**       | LOW                          | Indirect inference only, no direct client feedback                       |

## FINAL STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE SUMMARY

**Use Stakeholder Evidence To:**
1. ✅ **Identify blockers:** CEO (budget veto), Managers (implementation resistance), HR (workload refusal) - HIGH confidence
2. ✅ **Understand employee preferences:** Weekly recognition (33% baseline), manager-delivered (28% of impact), autonomy/growth (β = 0.29-0.33) - HIGH confidence
3. ✅ **Validate feasibility concerns:** Manager time burden (8 hours), HR capacity (13 hours), CEO zero-budget constraint - MEDIUM-HIGH confidence
4. ⚠️ **Predict CEO reaction:** Financial case strong ($200K turnover cost), but CEO perspective is proxy - MEDIUM-LOW confidence
5. ⚠️ **Predict client impact:** Indirect benefit (lower turnover), but no direct client voice - LOW confidence

**Stakeholder Evidence Confidence: MEDIUM (3 of 5 stakeholder groups well-represented, consistent patterns, but no direct primary data collection)**
