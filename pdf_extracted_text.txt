Overall Assessment
Purpose of Your Problem & Solution Framework Page: This
Problem & Solution Framework page is the foundation of your
dashboard and the first thing visitors encounter. It should provide a
clear, compelling introduction to your problem space—answering the
fundamental question: "What management problem am I looking at
and why does it matter?" Think of it as guiding readers through
understanding: establishing WHAT the problem is, WHY it matters,
WHO is affected, and HOW you'll measure success. Strong
information architecture here helps both readers grasp your problem
AND guides your own evidence collection in Module 2.

Organizing Your Dashboard Content: Your engagement challenge
under zero-salary constraint shows strong problem definition with
research grounding (Gallup Q12 2024, Saks 2023, SHRM statistics).
You have the building blocks in your three files—now focus on
organizing them on this page to guide readers. There are two
effective approaches:
1. Problem Architecture Approach (organize by components):
Create clear sections: WHAT (zero-salary constraint + 62%
engagement baseline) → WHY ($2.43M turnover cost drives non-
monetary intervention need) → WHO (five-category stakeholder
cascade: Senior Leaders → Managers → Employees → HR →
Vendors) → SUCCESS (12-week pilot with multiple decision criteria:
+4 points engagement OR +3% productivity, AND manager
usefulness ≥7/10, April 2026 decision)
Content mapping:
• Pull your constraint prominence from ask-problem-definition.txt
→ open WHAT section with "Zero salary budget established
upfront" transparency
• Pull your four-component intervention framework from ask-
problem-definition.txt → show comprehensive engagement
strategy (recognition + training + autonomy + growth)
• Pull your stakeholder cascade from ask-stakeholder-analysis.txt
→ emphasize managers as critical implementation layer between
leadership and employee experience
• Pull your pilot decision framework from ask-success-criteria.txt
→ highlight multiple simultaneous success conditions (not single
metric) with clear go/no-go criteria
2. Reader Journey Approach (tell as flowing story):
Open with compelling constraint-driven question: "62% engagement
and 18% turnover under zero salary budget constraint—what NON-
MONETARY interventions improve engagement?" Follow with
baseline specificity (Q4 2024 survey data, Jan-Oct 2025 HR records)
creating measurement foundation. Progress through stakeholder
implementation dependencies (managers navigating tension

between HR engagement expectations and employee compensation
expectations). Conclude with pilot program visibility (12-week
timeline, April 2026 decision) and financial analysis ($675K savings
converting turnover costs to engagement investment justification).
Visual aids strengthen both approaches: Consider creating a
stakeholder cascade diagram showing
Senior→Managers→Employees→HR→Vendors implementation
dependencies, a pilot decision framework flowchart with your
multiple criteria (engagement +4 OR productivity +3%, AND manager
usefulness ≥7/10), and a baseline→target ROI visualization
converting your financial analysis to table format (Current: 18%
turnover × 54 departures × $45K = $2.43M → Target: 13% turnover
× 39 departures × $45K = $1.76M → Savings: $675K).
See detailed sections below for specific feedback on each file's
content.
📋 Detailed Feedback by File
📄 Problem Definition File
File: ask-problem-definition.txt
Purpose: This file should establish WHAT the problem is and
WHY it matters to your organization. It creates the foundation for
your dashboard's narrative by helping readers understand the
current situation, its causes, and its consequences.

📍 Content Mapping for Dashboard
From this file → To your dashboard page:
• WHAT Section: Lead with constraint transparency: "How can
we improve employee engagement from 62% to 70% and
reduce turnover from 18% to 13% with ZERO salary budget—
no raises, no bonuses, no monetary incentives?" This
constraint-first framing sets realistic expectations and
establishes problem difficulty. Follow with baseline specificity
(62% engagement Q4 2024 survey, 18% turnover Jan-Oct
2025 HR records) creating measurement foundation. Then
introduce four-component intervention showing comprehensive
engagement strategy despite financial limitation.
• WHY Section: Emphasize financial impact quantification
converting turnover costs to engagement investment
justification: "Current state: 18% turnover = 54 departures ×
$45K replacement cost = $2.43M annual. Target state: 13%
turnover = 39 departures × $45K = $1.76M annual. Savings:
$675K first year, $1.35M two-year." This financial analysis
demonstrates non-monetary interventions' ROI—$2,000 per
manager operational budget generates $675K savings through
turnover reduction. Financial framing helps leadership see
engagement improvement as cost reduction strategy, not
expense.
• Constraint Emphasis Throughout: Integrate zero-salary
constraint visibility across all dashboard sections. Problem
Statement: "without monetary incentives." Stakeholder
Analysis: "Managers implement non-monetary interventions
while employees may expect raises." Success Criteria: "All
improvements achieved with operational budget $2,000 per
manager max, zero compensation increases." Repeated
constraint references prevent readers forgetting
implementation reality and keep solution design grounded in
organizational limitations.

📄 Stakeholder Analysis File
File: ask-stakeholder-analysis.txt
Purpose: This file identifies WHO is affected by and involved in
the problem. It provides the "people dimension" that makes your
problem concrete and helps readers understand competing
interests, influence levels, and engagement strategies.
📍 Content Mapping for Dashboard
From this file → To your dashboard page:
• WHO Section: Pull your five-category stakeholder framework
→ create cascading visual showing implementation
dependencies: Senior Leaders (approve/fund) → HR (design/
manage) → Managers (implement/coach) → Employees
(participate/provide feedback) ← Vendors (enable/support).
Arrows show decision flow downward and feedback flow
upward, with vendors supporting managers and HR
horizontally. This cascade visualization helps readers
understand that engagement initiatives require multi-level
coordination—leadership approval insufficient without manager
execution, employee participation impossible without manager
coaching.
• Constraint Tension Management: Highlight competing
stakeholder interests under zero-salary constraint. Senior
Leaders: "Improve engagement without budget increases"
(cost containment priority). Employees: "45% exceed
expectations—where's compensation recognition?"
(performance-reward expectation). Managers: "Implement
non-monetary interventions while employees expect raises"
(middle management squeeze). This tension acknowledgment
demonstrates sophisticated stakeholder analysis—interests
don't align perfectly, implementation requires navigating
conflicts. Provide resolution strategy: "Recognition platform

addresses public acknowledgment needs, growth opportunities
provide career advancement, autonomy provides intrinsic
motivation—creating compensation alternatives that satisfy
different needs."
• Manager as Critical Lever: Emphasize managers/team leads
as implementation success determinant. Create "Manager
Success Factors" section showing: Training (4-hour workshop
+ monthly coaching = capability building), Time Allocation
($2,000 per manager operational budget = resource
availability), Support Structures (HR provides templates,
vendors provide platform training = manager enablement),
Recognition Modeling (managers demonstrate recognition
platform use = behavioral leadership). This manager-centric
view recognizes that organizational initiatives succeed or fail at
middle management layer—engage managers deeply or risk
implementation failure.
📄 Success Criteria File
File: ask-success-criteria.txt
Purpose: This file defines WHAT SUCCESS looks like and HOW
you'll measure it. It connects your problem definition to evidence-
based outcomes by establishing specific, measurable criteria with
baselines and targets.
📍 Content Mapping for Dashboard
From this file → To your dashboard page:
• WHAT SUCCESS Section: Pull your dual outcome framework
→ create "Primary Outcome" (engagement 62%→70%,
turnover 18%→13%) paired with "Implementation Indicators"
(manager confidence 4.2→7/10, recognition frequency

23%→73% weekly). Primary outcomes show ultimate goals,
implementation indicators show intervention adoption. This
separation helps readers understand success has two
dimensions: ADOPTION (are people using interventions?
manager confidence rising, recognition increasing) and
IMPACT (are outcomes improving? engagement rising,
turnover falling). Both necessary—high adoption with low
impact signals wrong intervention, low adoption with any
impact signals implementation failure.
• Pilot Decision Framework: Highlight 12-week pilot structure
showing constrained experimentation before full commitment.
Create "Pilot Logic" visual: "Small-scale test (12 weeks, subset
of managers/employees) → Measure multiple dimensions
(engagement +4 OR productivity +3% AND managers ≥7/10
AND no red flags) → Make evidence-based decision (April
2026: scale, modify, or discontinue) → Full rollout only if
criteria met." This pilot framework demonstrates evidence-
based management—test hypotheses before scaling, establish
success criteria upfront, commit to data-driven decisions even
if results disappoint. Pilot de-risks large organizational change
by enabling course correction.
• Baseline-Target-ROI Visualization: Create three-column
comparison showing where you START (baselines with
sources), where you're GOING (targets with timelines), and
what it's WORTH (financial impact). Example structure:
Baseline Column (62% engagement Q4 2024 survey | 18%
turnover Jan-Oct 2025 HR records | 4.2/10 manager
confidence Sept 2025 survey | 23% weekly recognition
frequency) → Target Column (70% engagement +8 points 12-
month | 13% turnover -5 points 12-month | 7/10 manager
confidence +2.8 points 6-month | 73% weekly recognition +50
points 3-month) → ROI Column ($2.43M current turnover cost
| $1.76M target turnover cost | $675K Year 1 savings | $1.35M
Year 2 savings). This three-part structure helps readers grasp
problem magnitude (baselines), solution ambition (targets),
and business justification (ROI) simultaneously.

🔗 How These Three Files Work Together on Your
Dashboard
Your Problem Definition provides the WHAT and WHY that sets the
stage—helping readers understand the issue and why it matters. Your
Stakeholder Analysis adds the WHO that makes it concrete—
showing which groups are affected and how they'll be engaged. Your
Success Criteria establishes WHAT SUCCESS looks like and HOW
you'll measure progress—connecting the problem to evidence-based
outcomes.
Together, these three pieces create a complete picture that guides
your reader from understanding the problem → seeing who's involved
→ knowing how you'll measure success. This information flow is what
makes your dashboard effective as a decision-making tool.
