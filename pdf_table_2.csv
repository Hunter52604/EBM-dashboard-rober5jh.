Overall Assessment
"Purpose of Your Problem & Solution Framework Page: This
Problem & Solution Framework page is the foundation of your
dashboard and the first thing visitors encounter. It should provide a
clear, compelling introduction to your problem space—answering the
fundamental question: ""What management problem am I looking at
and why does it matter?"" Think of it as guiding readers through
understanding: establishing WHAT the problem is, WHY it matters,
WHO is affected, and HOW you'll measure success. Strong
information architecture here helps both readers grasp your problem
AND guides your own evidence collection in Module 2."
