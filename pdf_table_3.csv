,,"Organizing Your Dashboard Content: Your engagement challenge
under zero-salary constraint shows strong problem definition with
research grounding (Gallup Q12 2024, Saks 2023, SHRM statistics).
You have the building blocks in your three files—now focus on
organizing them on this page to guide readers. There are two
effective approaches:
1. Problem Architecture Approach (organize by components):
Create clear sections: WHAT (zero-salary constraint + 62%
engagement baseline) → WHY ($2.43M turnover cost drives non-
monetary intervention need) → WHO (five-category stakeholder
cascade: Senior Leaders → Managers → Employees → HR →
Vendors) → SUCCESS (12-week pilot with multiple decision criteria:
+4 points engagement OR +3% productivity, AND manager
usefulness ≥7/10, April 2026 decision)
Content mapping:
• Pull your constraint prominence from ask-problem-definition.txt
→ open WHAT section with ""Zero salary budget established
upfront"" transparency
• Pull your four-component intervention framework from ask-
problem-definition.txt → show comprehensive engagement
strategy (recognition + training + autonomy + growth)
• Pull your stakeholder cascade from ask-stakeholder-analysis.txt
→ emphasize managers as critical implementation layer between
leadership and employee experience
• Pull your pilot decision framework from ask-success-criteria.txt
→ highlight multiple simultaneous success conditions (not single
metric) with clear go/no-go criteria
2. Reader Journey Approach (tell as flowing story):
Open with compelling constraint-driven question: ""62% engagement
and 18% turnover under zero salary budget constraint—what NON-
MONETARY interventions improve engagement?"" Follow with
baseline specificity (Q4 2024 survey data, Jan-Oct 2025 HR records)
creating measurement foundation. Progress through stakeholder
implementation dependencies (managers navigating tension",,
