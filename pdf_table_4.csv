,"between HR engagement expectations and employee compensation
expectations). Conclude with pilot program visibility (12-week
timeline, April 2026 decision) and financial analysis ($675K savings
converting turnover costs to engagement investment justification).
Visual aids strengthen both approaches: Consider creating a
stakeholder cascade diagram showing
Senior→Managers→Employees→HR→Vendors implementation
dependencies, a pilot decision framework flowchart with your
multiple criteria (engagement +4 OR productivity +3%, AND manager
usefulness ≥7/10), and a baseline→target ROI visualization
converting your financial analysis to table format (Current: 18%
turnover × 54 departures × $45K = $2.43M → Target: 13% turnover
× 39 departures × $45K = $1.76M → Savings: $675K).
