,,"📍 Content Mapping for Dashboard
From this file → To your dashboard page:
• WHAT Section: Lead with constraint transparency: ""How can
we improve employee engagement from 62% to 70% and
reduce turnover from 18% to 13% with ZERO salary budget—
no raises, no bonuses, no monetary incentives?"" This
constraint-first framing sets realistic expectations and
establishes problem difficulty. Follow with baseline specificity
(62% engagement Q4 2024 survey, 18% turnover Jan-Oct
2025 HR records) creating measurement foundation. Then
introduce four-component intervention showing comprehensive
engagement strategy despite financial limitation.
• WHY Section: Emphasize financial impact quantification
converting turnover costs to engagement investment
justification: ""Current state: 18% turnover = 54 departures ×
$45K replacement cost = $2.43M annual. Target state: 13%
turnover = 39 departures × $45K = $1.76M annual. Savings:
$675K first year, $1.35M two-year."" This financial analysis
demonstrates non-monetary interventions' ROI—$2,000 per
manager operational budget generates $675K savings through
turnover reduction. Financial framing helps leadership see
engagement improvement as cost reduction strategy, not
expense.
• Constraint Emphasis Throughout: Integrate zero-salary
constraint visibility across all dashboard sections. Problem
Statement: ""without monetary incentives."" Stakeholder
Analysis: ""Managers implement non-monetary interventions
while employees may expect raises."" Success Criteria: ""All
improvements achieved with operational budget $2,000 per
manager max, zero compensation increases."" Repeated
constraint references prevent readers forgetting
implementation reality and keep solution design grounded in
organizational limitations.",,
