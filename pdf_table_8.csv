,,"23%→73% weekly). Primary outcomes show ultimate goals,
implementation indicators show intervention adoption. This
separation helps readers understand success has two
dimensions: ADOPTION (are people using interventions?
manager confidence rising, recognition increasing) and
IMPACT (are outcomes improving? engagement rising,
turnover falling). Both necessary—high adoption with low
impact signals wrong intervention, low adoption with any
impact signals implementation failure.
• Pilot Decision Framework: Highlight 12-week pilot structure
showing constrained experimentation before full commitment.
Create ""Pilot Logic"" visual: ""Small-scale test (12 weeks, subset
of managers/employees) → Measure multiple dimensions
(engagement +4 OR productivity +3% AND managers ≥7/10
AND no red flags) → Make evidence-based decision (April
2026: scale, modify, or discontinue) → Full rollout only if
criteria met."" This pilot framework demonstrates evidence-
based management—test hypotheses before scaling, establish
success criteria upfront, commit to data-driven decisions even
if results disappoint. Pilot de-risks large organizational change
by enabling course correction.
• Baseline-Target-ROI Visualization: Create three-column
comparison showing where you START (baselines with
sources), where you're GOING (targets with timelines), and
what it's WORTH (financial impact). Example structure:
Baseline Column (62% engagement Q4 2024 survey | 18%
turnover Jan-Oct 2025 HR records | 4.2/10 manager
confidence Sept 2025 survey | 23% weekly recognition
frequency) → Target Column (70% engagement +8 points 12-
month | 13% turnover -5 points 12-month | 7/10 manager
confidence +2.8 points 6-month | 73% weekly recognition +50
points 3-month) → ROI Column ($2.43M current turnover cost
| $1.76M target turnover cost | $675K Year 1 savings | $1.35M
Year 2 savings). This three-part structure helps readers grasp
problem magnitude (baselines), solution ambition (targets),
and business justification (ROI) simultaneously.",,
